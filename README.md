# Mathlab-NumericalAnalysis
********The numericalAnalysis file contains some very simple algorthims of some mathematical functions and methods like the newton method
or the detemination of different proper values of a certain matrice. 
The code is not documented at all. as it is given to my students and it's their job to document.
